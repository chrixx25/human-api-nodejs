The framework must dynamically load the Swagger file to create its routes. You can load the Swagger file through https://editor.swagger.io to understand the API requirements. 3. Feel free to add more properties in the Swagger file using the `x-*` notation to suit your needs (ie. routing requests to controllers and actions). 4. You can use the provided package.json file to start off your project. 5. Make a public fork of this repository and email the link to info@pragmanila.com.",
